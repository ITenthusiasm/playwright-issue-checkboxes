# Playwright Issue Checkboxes

Exemplifies Playwright's limitations with re-styled `checkbox`es (also applies to `radio`s).

The failing test case(s) can be found in [example.test.ts](./example.test.ts). To run the test(s), simply run `npx playwright test --ui`. (Or, if you **_don't_** want to run the tests in UI mode, then simply run `npx playwright test` instead.)
